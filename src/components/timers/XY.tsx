        <p>I am registered under noncredit status as this is the busiest time of year for me at work and staying timely on assignments was going to be difficult.  <br /> However, I really wanted to take the class and intend on working thorugh the assignments as time permits.  <br /> I hope to catch up on the XY timer while working through assignment 2. <br /> I understand that no grade is awarded but would appreciate any feedback you can provide on the completed components. </p>
        <ol>Additional Items to complete
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) XY Timer</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Better button functionality including DRY handler functions</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Additional styling for mobile options</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Improved styling on the tabata input boxes - smaller sizes</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Figure out how to fix the typescript errors</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) documentation</p>
